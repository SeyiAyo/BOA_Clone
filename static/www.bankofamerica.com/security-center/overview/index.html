fraud is on the rise, and it can cause your money, or even your identity, to be stolen. Following a few simple steps can help keep you safe this holiday season.<br><br><strong>To protect against mail fraud:</strong><br><ul><li>Try to avoid using blue mailboxes. Instead, hand mail directly to your postal carrier or go inside the post office.

and</li><br><li>“shared” means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li></ul><p>In the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we “shared” Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising, with respect to California residents covered by CCPA. As of the date of this Notice, we have ceased such practices and no longer “share” Personal Information. Our prior “sharing” activities were performed to deliver advertising and marketing, including on non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps, using Personal Information we collected or that you provided to assist our non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps to select bank ads or offers that appealed to you, to display them to you and to monitor your responses. In connection with such advertising and marketing activities, we previously “shared” Personal Information with our third party advertising and marketing vendors who were prohibited from using that Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the specifically requested advertising and marketing services.</p><p>Though we have ceased “sharing” Personal Information of California residents covered by CCPA, the categories of Personal Information that we did previously “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising in the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice are:</p><ul><li>Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers;</li><br><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding a California resident's interaction with an internet website application, or advertisement;</li><br><li>Geolocation data; and</li><br><li>Inferences drawn from any of the Personal Information listed above to create a profile about a California resident reflecting their preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, and attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.</li></ul><h4>How We Use Sensitive Personal Information</h4><p>We only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:</p><ul><li>To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.</li><br><li>To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.</li><br><li>To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.</li><br><li>To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.</li><br><li>For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.</li><br><li>To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.</li><br><li>To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.</li></ul><h4>Rights under the CCPA</h4><p>If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:</p><p style="margin-left:20px">(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.</p><p style="margin-left:20px">(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:</p><p style="margin-left:43px">a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;</p><p style="margin-left:43px">b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;</p><p style="margin-left:43px">c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;</p><p style="margin-left:43px">d. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and</p><p style="margin-left:43px">e. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;</p><p style="margin-left:20px">(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.</p><p style="margin-left:20px">(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.</p><p style="margin-left:20px">(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p><p>Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.</p><p>We will acknowledge receipt of your request and advise you how long we expect it will take to respond if we are able to verify your identity.

For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.</p><p>We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.</p><p>We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA.

This “Notice” constitutes our notice at collection and our privacy policy pursuant to the CCPA.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular California resident and includes certain categories of Personal Information discussed below that constitute “Sensitive Personal Information.” The CCPA, however, does not apply to certain information, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).</p><p>The specific Personal Information that we collect, use, and disclose relating to a California resident covered by the CCPA will vary based on our relationship or interaction with that individual. For example, this Notice does not apply with respect to information that we collect about California residents who apply for or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes. For more information about how we collect, disclose, and secure information relating to these customers, please refer to our <a id="uSConsumerPrivacyNotice" href="../consumer-privacy-notice/index.html" target="_blank">US Consumer Privacy Notice</a>.</p><p>Keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most important priorities.

and</li><li>“shared” means the disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li></ul><p>In the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we “shared” Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising, with respect to California residents covered by CCPA. As of the date of this Notice, we have ceased such practices and no longer “share” Personal Information. Our prior “sharing” activities were performed to deliver advertising and marketing, including on non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps, using Personal Information we collected or that you provided to assist our non-affiliated third party sites and mobile apps to select bank ads or offers that appealed to you, to display them to you and to monitor your responses. In connection with such advertising and marketing activities, we previously “shared” Personal Information with our third party advertising and marketing vendors who were prohibited from using that Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the specifically requested advertising and marketing services.</p><p>Though we have ceased “sharing” Personal Information of California residents covered by CCPA, the categories of Personal Information that we did previously “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising in the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice are:</p><ul class="list"><li>Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers;</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding a California resident's interaction with an internet website application, or advertisement;</li><li>Geolocation data; and</li><li>Inferences drawn from any of the Personal Information listed above to create a profile about a California resident reflecting their preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, and attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.</li></ul><h3>How We Use Sensitive Personal Information</h3><p>We only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:</p><ul class="list"><li>To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.</li><li>To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.</li><li>To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.</li><li>To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.</li><li>For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.</li><li>To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.</li><li>To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.</li></ul><h3>Rights under the CCPA</h3><p>If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:</p><p>(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.</p><p>(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:</p><p><span style="margin-left:20px">a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:20px">b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:20px">c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:20px">d. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and</span></p><p><span style="margin-left:20px">e. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;</span></p><p>(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.</p><p>(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.</p><p>(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p><p>Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.</p><p>We will acknowledge receipt of your request and advise you how long we expect it will take to respond if we are able to verify your identity. Requests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.</p><p>For individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.</p><p>For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.</p><p>In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.</p><p>We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.</p><p>We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.</p><h3>How We Process Opt-Out Preferences</h3><p>We have ceased “cross-contextual behavioral advertising” and do not “share” this data with any third parties, as such terms are defined by the CCPA.</p><p>Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt-out requests. Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt-out of sale/sharing for the browser.</p><h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3><p>If you are a California resident, you may submit a request by:</p><p>(1) Completing an online <a id="personalInformationRequestForm" href="https://secure.bankofamerica.com/customer-preferences/public/personal-information-request/#!/page1" target="_blank">Personal Information Request Form</a></p><p>(2) Calling 888.341.5000</p><h3>Questions or Concerns</h3><p>You may contact us with questions or concerns about this Notice and our practices by:</p><p>(1) Writing us at:</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;margin-left:23px">Individual Rights Operations TX-041-02-08</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;margin-left:23px">16001 N Dallas Pkwy Building 1</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;margin-left:23px">Addison, TX 75001</span></p><p>(2) Emailing us at <a id="emailUsLink" href="mailto:serviceinquiries4@bofa.com">serviceinquiries4@bofa.com</a></p><h3>Metrics</h3><p>Please visit <a id="ccpaMetrics" href="../../content/documents/security/sheet-06-21-0220_a_hr_ada.pdf" target="_blank">www.bankofamerica.com/ccpa-metrics</a> for data reporting published in accordance with Section 7102 of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations.</p><h3>Changes to This California Consumer Privacy Act Notice</h3><p>We may change or update this Notice from time to time.

In connection with such advertising and marketing activities, we previously “shared” Personal Information with our third party advertising and marketing vendors who were prohibited from using that Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the specifically requested advertising and marketing services.</p><p>Though we have ceased “sharing” Personal Information of California residents covered by CCPA, the categories of Personal Information that we did previously “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising in the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice are:</p><ul><li>Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers;</li><br><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding a California resident's interaction with an internet website application, or advertisement;</li><br><li>Geolocation data; and</li><br><li>Inferences drawn from any of the Personal Information listed above to create a profile about a California resident reflecting their preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, and attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.</li></ul><h4>How We Use Sensitive Personal Information</h4><p>We only use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for the following purposes consistent with CCPA Regulations:</p><ul><li>To perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average California resident who requests those goods or services. For example, a California resident's precise geolocation may be used by a mobile application that is providing them with directions on how to get to a specific location.</li><br><li>To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted Personal Information, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's log-in information to a data security company that it has hired to investigate and remediate a data breach that involved that individual's account.</li><br><li>To resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions directed at the business and to prosecute those responsible for those actions, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may use information about a California resident's ethnicity and/or the contents of email and text messages to investigate claims of racial discrimination or hate speech.</li><br><li>To ensure the physical safety of natural persons, provided that the use of a California resident's Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for this purpose. For example, we may disclose a California resident's geolocation information to law enforcement to investigate an alleged kidnapping.</li><br><li>For short-term, transient use, including, but not limited to, nonpersonalized advertising shown as part of a California resident's current interaction with us.</li><br><li>To perform services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying a California resident's information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytic services, providing storage.</li><br><li>To verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by us, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured by, manufactured for, or controlled by us.</li></ul><h4>Rights under the CCPA</h4><p>If you are a California resident covered by the CCPA, you have the right to:</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(1) Receive this Notice at or before the point of collection of your Personal Information.</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(2) Request we disclose to you free of charge the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:</p><p style='margin-left:43px;'>a. the categories of Personal Information about you that we collected;</p><p style='margin-left:43px;'>b. the categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;</p><p style='margin-left:43px;'>c. the purpose for collecting Personal Information about you;</p><p style='margin-left:43px;'>d. the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information about you and the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed (if applicable) and the purpose for disclosing the Personal Information about you; and</p><p style='margin-left:43px;'>e. the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(3) Request we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(4) Request we delete Personal Information we collected from you, unless the CCPA recognizes an exception.</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(5) Be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p><p>Please see the section below entitled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” for instructions explaining how you can exercise these rights described above.</p><p>We will acknowledge receipt of your request and advise you how long we expect it will take to respond if we are able to verify your identity. Requests for specific pieces of Personal Information will require additional information to verify your identity.</p><p>For individuals submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.</p><p>For a company or organization submitting a request on behalf of another person, we may require proof of authorization from the individual such as a Power of Attorney and verification of identity directly from the person for whom the request is made.</p><p>In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual. Additionally, we will not honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another California resident or where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA's access or deletion rights.</p><p>We will advise you in our response if we are not able to honor your request. We will not provide Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers or government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, unique biometric data, health care or medical identification numbers, account passwords or security questions and answers, or any specific pieces of information if the disclosure presents the possibility of unauthorized access that could result in identity theft or fraud or unreasonable risk to data or systems and network security.</p><p>We will work to process all verified requests within 45 days pursuant to the CCPA. If we need an extension for up to an additional 45 days in order to process your request, we will provide you with an explanation for the delay.</p><h4>How We Process Opt-Out Preferences</h4><p>We have ceased “cross-contextual behavioral advertising” and do not “share” this data with any third parties, as such terms are defined by the CCPA.</p><p>Bank of America permits California residents to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of sale/sharing through opt-out preference signals without having to make individualized opt-out requests.  Bank of America treats opt-out preference signals as valid requests to opt-out of sale/sharing for the browser.</p><h4>How to Exercise Your Rights</h4><p>If you are a California resident, you may submit a request by:</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(1) Completing an online <a id='personalInformationRequestForm' href='https://secure.bankofamerica.com/customer-preferences/public/personal-information-request/#!/page1' target='_blank'>Personal Information Request Form</a></p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(2) Calling 888.341.5000</p><h4>Questions or Concerns</h4><p>You may contact us with questions or concerns about this Notice and our practices by:</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(1) Writing us at:</p><p style='font-style:italic;margin-left:43px;'>Individual Rights Operations TX-041-02-08</p><p style='font-style:italic;margin-left:43px;'>16001 N Dallas Pkwy Building 1</p><p style='font-style:italic;margin-left:43px;'>Addison, TX 75001</p><p style='margin-left:20px;'>(2) Emailing us at <a id='emailUsLink' href='mailto:serviceinquiries4@bofa.com'>serviceinquiries4@bofa.com</a></p><h4>Metrics</h4><p>Please visit <a id='ccpaMetrics' href='/ccpa-metrics' target='_blank'>www.bankofamerica.com/ccpa-metrics</a> for data reporting published in accordance with Section 7102 of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations.</p><h4>Changes to This California Consumer Privacy Act Notice</h4><p>We may change or update this Notice from time to time.
